  Systick Interrupt Handler
  SysTick interrupt happens every 1 ms
  The calling function sets the tick counter to the number of milliseconds
  it wishes to delay the program and then goes in a loop waiting for this
  to be reduced to zero, meaning the required milliseconds have passed.
  The SysTick handler decrements the tick counter every millisecond.
